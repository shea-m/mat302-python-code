This repository contains various scripts and scrapwork that I have made for my
coursework in MAT302: Introduction to Algebraic Cryptography at University of
Toronto Mississauga. It is currently broken down into three sections:

Encryption_Algorithms
- Contains encryption/decryption functions and brute force algorithms for
  various algorithms and encryption methods discussed including:
  - Caeser Cypher
  - Affine Cypher
  - Elgamal Key Exchange
  - RSA

Utility_Files
- Contains various utilities used primarily for brute force attack functions,
  as well as for some encryption stuff including:
  - Miller-Rabin Primality Test and Prime Generator
  - Pollard's Rho Factorization
  - Fermat's Factorization
 
Scrapwork for Assignments
- This is just scrapwork and brainstorming for my assignments for the course,
  most of it is irrelevant as the actual code can be seen in the other folders
