As noted in the readme, this repository contains implementations of algorithms
discussed in MAT302: Introduction to Algebraic Cryptography at University of
Toronto. The implementation of these algorithsm was based on work done in class
and based on the course notes provided by Professor Qun Wang. This folder will
contain some brief overview of each of the algorithms and utilities used here.
