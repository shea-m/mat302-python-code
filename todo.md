# TODO

- Organization needs to be fixed: importing files is messy
- Add package structure (have to learn how to do this first)
    - Want to have package for Utilities (mat302Utilities?)
    - Want package for encryption algorithms
    - If I just rename to encrypt/decrypt, then import whole folder will it
      be like rsa.encrypt etc?
    - This is the lowest priority
- Reorganize homework files
- Must be a cleaner sol than sys.path.append(".") everytime?

- Make elliptic curve class?
