# TODO

- Organization needs to be fixed: importing files is messy
- Add package structure (have to learn how to do this first)
    - Want to have package for Utilities (mat302Utilities?)
    - Want package for encryption algorithms
    - If I just rename to encrypt/decrypt, then import whole folder will it
      be like rsa.encrypt etc?
    - This is the lowest priority
- Reorganize homework files
- Must be a cleaner sol than sys.path.append(".") everytime?
- in primality check: add a subfolder that outputs all the current print info
  to be something like [prime_number]_primalitycheck.txt

- Make elliptic curve class?
  - EC Class with EC point as subclass?
  - Would make adding points easier I think
  - Update representation of O from (0,0) to (inf, inf) or something similar
  - Update input variables to be more clear (i.e. be consistent with what is used for Order)
  - Rename ec.addition file

# TODO: Over Summer
- Move everything currently here to a subfolder "winter2024-work"
- Work on optimized versions of everything and make it better organized
- Rename repository to cryptography utilities or something?
- Update SPH to use the indexing version
